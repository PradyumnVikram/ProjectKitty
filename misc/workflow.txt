- task 1 - identify thr part where the person is long jumping and trim from downloaded videos
	- running
	- take off
	- fight
	- land
	
	- Clip a reference video for 5 seconds manually
	- use that reference video to extract clips of people performing long jumps
	- since athletes are professional we can expect similar position during start and end times
	
	- consider peceptual hashing + pose extraction from mediapipe -> did not give desired result
    - Used a ResNet18-3D, trained on kinetics 400, extracted features from first 5 layers (stem + 8 residual blocks), applied cosine similarity to identify timestamps
    - split video into small chunks so that my computer doesnt crash
    - manually weeded out extremities from the dataset
    
- task 2 - we now have a dataset at hand, now we start the analysis
    - first appraoch is to extract features and create a new dataset which can be clustered in 4 phases, considering KMeans
    - hip_vel_y, hip_vel_x, hip_y, lower_foot, left_knee_angle, right_knee_angle, hip_leg_angle are considered features
    - detects run up pretty well fails to classify flight
    - added some features
    - smoothening in features via median filter and in design matrix via savitsky golay filter and normalisation
    - clusters well except for some error, directly going to smooth labels now by assuming order of phases
    - works pretty well

- task 3 - final keypoints extracted and segmented
    - anomaly detection can be consiedered one class SVM, Isolation forest - this requires for me to extract features such as mean, median, mode etc.
    - train an LSTM/TCN (no idea what that is, will require understanding their mechanisms first)
    - one class SVM worked pretty well, extracted 2 features per phase for anomaly detection, contours plotted show good capturing of data
